# Railway Deployment Trigger
# This file forces Railway to detect changes and redeploy

# Deployment timestamp: $(date)
# All fixes applied:
# - Fixed pandas/numpy compatibility issues
# - Fixed django_filters import errors
# - Updated to use gunicorn instead of runserver
# - Configured health check to use root path '/'
# - Reduced health check timeout to 30 seconds

# This should trigger automatic redeployment
